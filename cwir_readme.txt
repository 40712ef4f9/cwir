CWIR 1.65
1) Compatibility with 4.1 patch

CWIR 1.55 RC
1) Further improvements to station destruction.
 
CWIR Version 1.5 RC
1) Fixes to Station destruction, ships should destroy stations correctly.
2) Changes to Capital ship missiles making them have a larger range and do more damage. Astrobee, V Launcher and Torpedoes (just range and lifetime for this one)

CWIR Version 1.4 RC
1) Fixes to Assigntocommander and mmvoyager scripts
2) Changes to HV faction, should be able to get rid of it completely now.

CWIR Version 1.3 RC
1) Should fix problem of new commanders being placed on ships when docking at a shipyard.
2) fixes to the escort script. Ships were not always properly disappearing when their jobs were finished. Should now disappear after a couple hours.
3) New plunder command for your ships. Command is located in the following dialogue option: *pilot* -> more ... -> Voyager -> Do Plunder at ... 

In order for plunder to work properly you need to be docked (the albion) at a station or CV that needs the resources/tradeware because this will be used for the plunder command.
For example, if you are building a station but your CV is missing some high tech resource. You can dock at the CV and then comm one of your ships which will be used for the plunder,
tell it to plunder and then your ship will look at what the CV needs and go and try to plunder the resources. They take relation into account and wont attack friendly factions.
They will also loot wares that are left behind in a zone after battles, etc. The plunder command can be used on small ships too, but they wont attack because of how weak they are.
They will search for lost wares in zones and try to collect them however. Pilot skill is taken into account.


CWIR Version 1.25 RC
1) Should fix HV and Split not disappearing 100% when entirely destroyed. 

CWIR Version 1.2 RC
1) New feature! Replicate ships at your own shipyard! If you own your own shipyard, you can replicate (clone construction) any ship that you own at your own shipyard. You will still have to have the full resources required to build the ship, but you will be able to build any ship that you already own. 

 How it works is, you have to be in the same zone as your shipyard with whatever ship you want to "clone". Call up your ship trader, must be same size ship trader. Choose the option for replicate and then select the ship and voila! 

 2) Some minor bug fixes.


 
CWIR Version 1.1 RC 

 1) S collector name will appear correctly in buy list of Xenon matrix 

 2) NPC's will now spawn on Xenon stations. These are Xenon synthetic lifeforms, just like you are when playing the Xenon start! This means, you can now get a trade agent on the Xenon matrix and you can hire crew, buy missiles, use a mechanic, etc. This should fix the issue with the Xenon matrix not always showing what it is buying, let me know if it works fine (need trade agent on xenon matrix) 

 3) When buying S collectors, you can now equip them with the correct drones. 

 4) Fix for Mining/collectors to be able to select a resource to gather. Seems there is a VANILLA issue where if there are more than 5 resources in a zone, it wont display all possible resources to collect (it shows all minerals first and then gases so all gases wont display). Thanks to Unitrader for fix.

 5) Fix for ships being built at NPC shipyards for the player (they were giving you full crew when they shouldnt)

 CWIR RC 1.0 
 1) Changed zone patrol behavior (let me know if it doesn't work, might need to reassign ships) 
 2) Some other minor fixes here and there. 

 CWIR Beta Version 2.0B 

 1) Hopefully a fix for loop and freeze issues 
 2) Fix for duplicate PMC shipyard (if you already have one in your game it will stay there) 
 3) Some other fixes/changes/improvements
 4) Can turn off Taxes, expenses and/or the npc spawning on player stations in the config
 
CWIR Version 2.0A 
 1) New Xenon stations, and invasion logic (The invasion logic is still being worked on for more nasty surprises, but it is mostly finished). 
 2) New Xenon start! This is intended to be difficult and limited to mostly conquest. There is a very basic Xenon economy (they only harvest 
    ores and gases). They have a shipyard and something else which is a secret Smile You will have to figure it out on your own! Xenon will 
    produce ships at their shipyards and will invade all clusters if they can! They do have a logic to their invasions, but they will still 
    send ships out haphazardly too. Do not leave them to go unchecked forever...... 
 3) New Xenon gas collector medium ship (same as ore miner but it collects gases) 
 4) If playing as Xenon, small and medium ships cost nothing to buy and can be bought en mass as much as you want as long as the shipyard has them! 
    For L and XL ships, you will have to pay some credits (this is mostly due to certain limitations but also balancing) but they are pretty cheap.
    As there is no significant xenon economy, the only way to earn credits is by selling gas/ore to the shipyard (but this is a VERY SLOW way since 
   they don't hold a lot of cargo and ores/gases don't give that much credits) or by boarding ships and selling them to the xenon shipyard (by which 
   ships will also be used by the xenon, basically "assimilation"). 
 5) The story is that the Xenon have decided to develop Synthetic lifeforms to mimic humans (who created them to begin with). (Actually, because of
    the game engine and certain limitations, we need to add npcs to the xenon faction in order for the player to play as a xenon and for the shipyard 
    to function correctly). Despite these limitations, though, I think it is a pretty cool idea that the Xenon have developed synthetics in order to 
    infiltrate the organics for the purposes of destroying them all! You play as Xenon Synthetic lifeform 0 and your co pilot is #1! The rest of the 
    xenon npcs are further production of said synthetic lifeforms. 
 6) The xenon start is not entirely complete (need to work on story and such), but it is mostly complete. 
 7) Bug fixes and performance improvements/changes to spawning scripts, etc. 

 If you want to check out the new Xenon stations and see what they do, try starting a new game as a Xenon! The stations are very very cool and fit right in with the Xenon, I assure you. Not to mention what the special station does Smile Let's see if you can figure it out. This particular station won't start spawned already in the zone, it will be built there though in time.

CWIR Version 1.95 Beta
1) Couple of clean up scripts/bug fixes
2) HEV initialization script for HEV stations if no crew and production
3) Secrets


CWIR Version 1.9 Beta 

1) Some improvements to the movement scripts/updating 
2) Some bug fixes and changes to jobs 
3) Minor changes to various scripts/balance changes/performance 
4) New Architect command (Build station in zone, pick zone from map)

 CWIR Version 1.8 Beta changelog 

 PLEASE READ SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR THOSE UPDATING TO 1.8 ON PAGE 215!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ONLY NECESSARY FOR THOSE WITH AN ALBION SHIPYARD! 

 1) New Diplomacy feature, donate ships. 
 2) Ships built at a player shipyard will now come with a full crew of w to high level quality (taking from your own station population). I will set the range from 1 to 5 and it will be random. If you want to change the range, open up npc_shiptrader.xml in the MD folder of the mod. In the Buildfinished cue, pretty much at the top, find the cwircommander, cwirengineer, cwirdefence, cwirarchitect and change the numbers, you can see all the skills listed there so it is self explanatory. 
 3) Faction specific shipyards, all shipyards in the game (excluding DLC) are now faction specific! 
 4) Improvements to brspawnnpc file (now spawns less specialists and specialist clean up if too many) 
 5) Some minor bug fixes/improvements. 
 6) There are now a total of 6 Sanahar Ships for HOA. There is a Container, bulk, energy, liquid, and 2 different hybrids (one B and L, one C and E) 
 7) HOA JOB traders now only use Sanahar ships! 
 8 ) Heretic Vanguard station in Murky Skies switched to Franton Pharma 

  
 

CWIR Beta Version 1.7
 1) Added new feature "contractor". Hire a contractor to take care of building a station for you! Will build all modules and surface elements. 
 You WILL NOT have access to the station until it is done and building the station may take a long time, keep that in mind! Also, remember, you must have the credits in your personal account to purchase the entire station when it is done or else the station will be sold to someone else! This could also be used to have factions obtain new stations if you intentionally do not put money in your account when it is done. 

 2) All escort ships for Jobs fleets are now configurable in the cm_config file!!! Think the Job fleets have too many ships or your PC is having trouble with so many ships? Edit the config file to lower the amount of Capital ship escorts and fighter escorts accompanying job fleets (Job fleets are always led by ONE ship, either a Capital ship or fighter ship and then escorts get added to that one ship). REMEMBER TO EDIT THE CONFIG TO SET THIS TO YOUR LIKING OR TO THE CAPABILITY OF YOUR PC. THIS MEANS THAT EVEN PEOPLE WITH LOWER END PC's CAN ENJOY THE MOD BY SETTING THE ESCORTS TO A LOWER NUMBER! 

 3) Fixes/improvements to scout behavior and invasion fleets. 

 4) Brand new Fleetulator! Script that handles automatic fleet creation for Invasion fleets, troop transport invasion fleets, Job Escorts for Job fleets, etc. All which can be configured in the cm_config file. Want more ships? You can do that. Want less ships? You can do that too! Smart and intelligent population of escorts for all factions in the game! It is also slightly random so there will be many different variations of fleets! 

 5) All military Capital ships which are built at a shipyard by NPC faction or any Capital ship the player sells to a NPC shipyard will find a fleet or squad to join and will go and join that squad/fleet. 
 For small ships, any military small ship you sell to a faction will join an existing squad/fleet and will go and fight and patrol and such! (thanks to w.evans for helping me with this and also Unitrader!) 

 What this means is that you could potentially be a shipyard company that supplies a faction with ships for their wars (or just a supporter of a faction helping the war effort). 

 Previously, the ships sold to a faction would move.patrol but they would remain alone. Now they will join other fleets/squads which makes them even more effective! Selling multiple ships at a time will have them form up into squads and they will go out and fight! 

 Even small ships which are produced at NPC shipyards, when not used by jobs but spawned out of the shipyard, will also have jobs to fulfill. NO SHIP WILL BE WASTED BY MOVE.DIE AGAIN! 

 6) New mechanics for selling ships to your own shipyard!! Now you can be a real shipyard dealer in every sense of the word! If you sell ships to another faction shipyard, they will join that faction. However, if you sell ships to your own shipyard, you will be selling to any potential buyer of any faction you are of neutral or higher standing with. These ships will be purchased by these other factions and used for whatever the purpose of the ship is. Military ships will go on patrol or find other fleets/squads to join, trade ships will trade, mining ships will mine, etc. You will also now receive a reduced mark up on ships you sell to your own shipyard. You will no longer receive a 50% mark up, now you will only receive a 15% markup (subject to change based on feedback).
 
 
CWIR Beta Version 1.6 
 1) Improved scout/invasion files 
 2) Improved brspawnnpc file (script that spawns employees on your stations, should limit specialists to a max of 10 which should stop any issues of bugged out npcs (although I haven't had the issue) 
 3) Changed credits you receive from selling ships to your own shipyard from 50% to 42% 
 4) Updated MICT escort script which is included in CWIR (escorts should be better now) 
 5) Minor changes to fight script. 
 6) 3 New game starts, PMC, AG, and HOA. 

 
CWIR Beta Version 1.5
1) Bug fixes (of course) (mostly minor stuff)
2) Changes to the fight script for, what we hope, is better performance but mileage may vary here depending on your PC. This is a difficult thing because we add so many features into the fight/turret scripts and if we have to take them out for performance, it kind of defeats the purpose. If you didn't know, our fight scripts have smart targeting of turrets, stops ships from firing on ships you are boarding, etc. 
3) NPC invasions against the player! NPC factions you are enemies with will send out scouts looking for your stations, if they find your stations (even in empty space) they will report back to their base. If they report on your asset locations, an invasion of your assets may take place! Be on guard! 
4) Some balance changes and also beefing up of security forces in certain zones. Factions will now defend gate zones and jump beacon zones much more heavily (an extra fleet, ROC consolidates Devries more when in control). 
5) Fixed shipdealers and shiptraders for compatibility with the different menu's when you sell ships.


CWIR Beta Version 1.4
 1) Fixes to bugs with diplomacy features 
 2) possible fix for attaching cvs to captured stations 
 3) improvements to ships attacking stations both IZ and OOZ. 
 4) Changed Diplomacy so that you receive reputation when trade is 10 million plus in favor of AI faction 
 5) Minor balance changes 
 6) More German language support 
 7) Increased Radar Range for most ships (to help them find some of the newer build locations which may be out of their initial range) 
 8) Improvements in the Station destruction code

 Still investigating 
 1) issues with build locations not being freed after station destruction (Have not been able to reproduce this, seems to be working on my end)


CWIR Beta Version 1.3 

 1) Several bug fixes to patrol script, construction scripts and clean up of some debug log errors 

 2) Change in how much tax income you get to a tenth of what it was previously, but you will now receive taxes every 30 minutes. If you were receiving 10 million in taxes an hour before, you would now be receiving 1 million in taxes twice an hour, so 2 million per hour. 

 3) New feature! Diplomacy! 
 
 4) New feature : New radial menu option for patrol object! You can select any object to patrol from the universe map. Patrol jump beacons, patrol gates, ships, stations, etc. for more strategic defense. 

 5) New option to disable the jump flee mechanics in vanilla. You can edit the config file to turn off the feature that has ships jumping away when in danger.



 Explanation of how Diplomacy works 

 You can contact a Defense Officer on a station to negotiate various diplomatic options. You must contact a Defense officer who works on a station, not the hireable defense officers you can recruit. 

 Contacting a Defense officer working on an NPC station will give you a new dialogue option, Diplomacy. You can't contact a Defense officer of a faction you are enemies with to negotiate, instead, you must contact a Defense officer of a faction you are neutral and above with in order to negotiate. 

 In order to negotiate with a faction you are enemies with, you must contact another faction that is not enemies with the faction you want to negotiate with. So for example, the following: 

 If you are at war with PMC but you want to make peace with PMC, you can't negotiate with PMC directly, however, you can contact a mediator in order to negotiate with PMC. Any faction that is neutral to, or friendly with PMC can be contacted. So, you could contact Ledda Industrial, or Albion Energy subsidiary or another corporation that is neutral to PMC in order to negotiate with PMC. They will mediate the negotiations. You can then contact the Defense officer on a Ledda Industrial (or other corporation) station and choose the appropriate options in the dialogue menu to negotiate. 

 You can buy/sell/trade stations, zones, even whole sectors if you own any fully. You can even give tribute to increase relations, make peace, make war, etc. There are calculations which determine the value of whatever it is you are trading and the calculations also take into account the strength of the factions you are negotiating with. NPC factions will always try to get the better deal.


CWIR 1.2 Beta
1) Several important bug fixes.

CWIR 1.1 Beta 
 1) Bug fixed and more bug fixes. 

 CWIR 1.0 Beta 
 1) New fight.attack.capital script which will not freeze your game and also some new functionality. Allied ships shouldn't attack your boarding target once hull reaches a certain amount. Also allied ships won't attack hull of stations you or NPCs are boarding. 
 2) Fixed hyperdrive so that it works properly and now you can't just send probes out to anywhere you need to drop them in a zone and you can hyperdrive to probes and jump gates. 
 3) New feature Station boarding for NPCs and player. NPCs will attempt to board the stations of their enemies and the player! These also include new invasions followed by a new troop ship. 
 4) stations that get destroyed will no longer respawn. They will now be constructed by a CV by any faction that takes over the zone. These CVs don't need resources to construct these replacement stations. 
 5) other misc. bug fixes and some balance changes 
 6) A few new messages which will be written into your log keeping you informed about what is going on in the universe (telling you about invasions taking place with troop ships, keeping you informed when you board stations, etc.) 
 7) Marines have an upkeep cost (part of the salary that must be paid out) 
 8 ) Some balance and performance tweaks (removed many of the fighter escorts for medium freighters, but not all) 
 9) Fixes to how trade and mining ships act when stations get boarded and captured. 
 10) ROC will now build some new stations, they will build 2 new metalworks stations in Scorched Aura and 1 new crystal refinery there too. They will also build a construction shop in Darned Hot Air. 
 11) Some balance tweaks (also some streamlining, removed all escorts for MEDIUM size freighters so hopefully that will help performance a little) 
 12) New Station rebuilding script. Does not require save/reload and factions will rebuild their stations. Some minor work needs to be done in Omicron with this (to take into account if Heretic Vanguards conquer OL, but other than that everything is good). In Albion, all factions will rebuild their stations, if HOA conquers PMC territory, they will rebuild PMC stations for themselves, same for PMC in HOA territory. Some unique stations will not be rebuilt unless by original faction 
 13) Some stations are weird and will look strange until rebuilt fully, like the PMC exchange, this is known and it is because they weren't supposed to be able to be built so they are not in proper build order, etc. No big deal with this. 
 14) Stations which get boarded and taken over wont have ships coming to them if they are enemy, ships will now stop trading/docking/whatever with stations which were boarded and captured by another faction. 
 15) You can now help defend a station from being boarded by destroying the troop ship even after marines have boarded the station. 
 16) New Xenon outposts 
 17) Performance tweaks (Better cues for hopefully better performance) 
 18) NPC Corporations will build new stations which will require resources to build just like you! 



CWIR 1.0 Preview Beta
1) New fight.attack.capital script which will not freeze your game and also some new functionality. Allied ships shouldn't attack your boarding target once hull reaches a certain amount. Also allied ships won't attack hull of stations you or NPCs are boarding. 
2) Fixed hyperdrive so that it works properly and now you can't just send probes out to anywhere you need to drop them in a zone and you can hyperdrive to probes and jump gates. 
3) New feature Station boarding for NPCs and player. NPCs will attempt to board the stations of their enemies and the player! These also include new invasions followed by a new troop ship. 
4) stations that get destroyed will no longer respawn. They will now be constructed by a CV by any faction that takes over the zone. These CVs don't need resources to construct these replacement stations. 
5) other misc. bug fixes and some balance changes 
What is not in yet: 
1) NPC station construction (new stations which will need resources)


CWIR Version 0.9g Changelog:
 1) Support for HOL DLC and Rebirth 4.0
 2) Balance tweaks

 CWIR Version 0.9d Changelog:
 1) Galaxy Range will now work with miners assigned to stations 
 2) There shouldn't be any more issues with enemy security forces spawning from stations (I hope) 
 3) Russian translation and language support (thanks to Davedee) 
 4) some other minor fixes and such. 


 CWIR Version 0.9 Changelog: 
 1) War between Heretic Vanguard and Argon Government will be about 60% of the way complete, what this means is: 
 a) HV could be completely eliminated by Argon Government 
 b) Support for HV to conquer both Devoid Clime and Commerce Core 
 c) Argon Defense of Devoid Clime and Commerce Core and counter attacks if necessary. 
 d) Argon government build up of forces in Sigma Sector if they conquer it (turn Sigma Sector into a veritable stronghold in preparation for XENON) 
 2) OPCV (Outpost Construction Vessel). THIS IS HOW IT WORKS, open up the universe map and go to sector view, then look at the zones in a sector, click plot course and then the menu will open up, and there are 4 options there. "Build outpost at my zone" "Build outpost at chosen zone" and then 2 for probes, same deal. If you want to build an outpost in your current zone, select build at my zone. If you want to build in another zone, just make sure when you click plot course, it is on the zone you want the outpost to build in. You will need 10 million credits and that's it, hit the choice and the outpost CV will be spawned near a shipyard if possible and then go to the place you picked and it will build an outpost. NPC factions have to do the same (outpost cv can be destroyed) 
 3) Split now strongly defend their home (Blurred Reflection and Sixth Scripture) - Split can also now be completely eliminated. For now, they will never leave Blurred Reflection. They will come into conflict with Heretic Vanguard (who look for resources in their space) and Xenon. 
 4) Seeded resources in Split space for HV to mine. 
 5) Bug fixes 
 6) New Heretic Vanguard Game start! Friend to HV, and neutral to Omicron Lyrae Corporations. Enemy to Argon government and EVERYONE else! 
 Heretic Vanguard strategy is strong turtling defense in sectors it controls, slow invasions of new territory. (Slower spawning but greater numbers as they conquer sectors and focus on heavy shielding and reinforced hulls, less firepower, greater diversity in role of ships) 
 Argon favors Blitzkrieg type attacks with overwhelming firepower (faster spawn times, heavy focus on firepower with good shielding and hull, less diversity of ships) 


 Changelog for Version 0.8B Alpha 
 1) Fix for destruction of player stations and NPC stations. NPC stations shouldn't have any issues being destroyed and player stations should be able to be destroyed now. 
 2) removed managers from outposts, hopefully no tradeoffer issues? Let me know (but this will only work on brand new outposts) 
 3) You can now go into the config file in the MD folder and turn off the automated builder if you would prefer not to use it or just change the amount of money needed to activate it. 
 4) Free Construction Vessel has been removed on new games. 

 
 Changelog for Version 0.8 Alpha 
 1) New "tax" script which gives taxes to the player based on how many docking bays a station has and a random amount of NPC's that may have visited the stations. This is to simulate the kinds of fees, taxes, etc. that people pay when traveling to stations or selling their goods on stations, etc. Zones you own with your stations or with NPC stations will have NPCs who pay these various "taxes" 
 2) New Salary Script. You must pay your employees a salary! There are some limitations here. Money comes out of the player's account, not any managers. If you have no money then it wont take any money from you so the system could be cheated by having no money in your account when the time comes to pay salaries. Salaries should not be so great that it is too much of a hindrance, though. Salaries are relatively low but if you have a lot of employees it adds up. 
 3) Heretic Vanguard as a real faction. HV has a large and small shipyard, they have all kinds of production stations as well. Sigma Sector in Maelstrom is their stronghold and they will defend it to the death! They have everything they need in Sigma Sector for an economy and production. They are at war with Argon government and everyone else except for the corporations of Omicron Lyrae. Heretic Vanguard use the Titan Armory Capital ships and normal Omicron lyrae trade ships. KNOWN ISSUE - MAY NEED A NEW GAME START TO SEE THE SHIPYARD IN SUNKEN FRIGATE FOR HERETIC VANGUARDS 
 4) In current version, NPC outposts can be difficult to destroy in zone because of the Zoltek Reactor, this should now be fixed but please let me know if it isn't. KNOWN ISSUES PLAYER OUTPOSTS AND OTHER PLAYER STATIONS DONT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO BE DESTROYED CURRENTLY WORKING ON IT 
 5) Micro jumping (safe jumps) have been changed to be more effective and informative. Now, chance to jump is based on the shield percentage of your ships, so more damage to shields, greater chance of jumping to safety. 
 6) Other small bug fixes, tweaks and changes. 
 THIS IS NOT IN YET BUT HOPEFULLY WILL BE IN NEXT RELEASE!!!! 
 1) New outpost CV which is somewhat automated. We are still working on the specifics with this. As of right now, the way it works is that you purchase an "Outpost CV" from a shipyard, which is different from a normal CV. It is much more expensive and it only builds an outpost. It does not require any resources to build the outpost as it has all the required resources necessary to do so. You wont order them to build like a normal CV, but there will be a command for build outpost in this zone and the CV will come and build an outpost in the zone you conquered. NPC factions will also use outpost CV's. When needed, an outpost CV will be spawned at their faction shipyard (or if no shipyard, one of their zones) and it will fly to the zone and attempt to build an outpost. 
 Known issues with this: If an outpost CV is constructing a station and it is destroyed, the station will still continue to build whatever module it was building when the CV was destroyed. It won't build any further modules, but it will finish the one it was building. Your ships wont target the constructing module (although they will destroy whatever modules are finished). Module needs to be fully built to be destroyed. THIS IS STILL UNDER GOING DEVELOPMENT AND THERE ARE ISSUES THAT STILL NEED TO BE WORKED OUT 
 We will need feedback on all the new features as well as the Heretic Vanguard faction! Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions, thanks! 


 Changelog for CWIR Alpha Version 0.65 
 1) War in Albion and Devries is COMPLETE!! (minus tweaking, balancing and changing of pace which will be most likely constantly changing depending on feedback and such). Fleets will patrol certain zones of importance, attack or defend zones, etc. This is partially dynamic (Fleets follow certain pre determined patrol routes, but can choose these at random in some cases and in others they do not have much choice. This is a different way of doing things than the algorithms that Rubini coded in CM but should give the illusion of realism. Fleets will travel just like you your fleets do). Full support for PMC, HOA, REIVERS and ROC. Each faction will grow as they conquer territory and will secure what they conquer. HOA can take over all of Albion and will grow stronger. Reivers or ROC can take over all of DEVRIES and grow stronger. PMC could take over all of Albion and most of Devries and grow stronger. 
 2) Every single faction in Albion and Devries is now completely able to be fully destroyed! Everything can be destroyed and eliminated, including all trade ships, stations and military ships. They will not keep spawning or come back if you are able to defeat them. (As a side note, using the mod that allows stations to be constructed by the player for a NPC faction could very well bring a faction back from destruction) 
 3) Micro Jump issue with player ships should now be fixed. (RUBINI FEELS THIS IS FIXED BUT NEEDS TESTING) 
 4) Changes to Retaliation forces so that they shouldn't be overwhelming anymore. 
 5) Minor bug fixes, etc. 
 6) Pace of war has been slowed down. Fleets do not spawn as often as before and depending on the fleet may take a considerable time to re-spawn (think as much as 2 hours in some cases, please give feedback on this). 
 7) Much greater variation in fleet sizes (They range from very small to very large. Small fleets might only have 3 or 4 capital ships with their fighter escorts, which also vary. Large fleets might have a dozen or so capital ships with their fighter escorts, which also vary. Need Feedback on this as to performance!) 
 8 ) New Script by Rubini that can simulate the buying of resources for your CV's. How it works is, if you give your Architect an excess of 5 million credits, he will simulate the purchase of resources in order to construct stations. Over time, he will buy resources (no ships will actually deliver). If you give your Architect less than 5 million, the Architect will not simulate the buying of resources. This script will allow you to build a station even if you can't find the necessary resources out there. For example, if there aren't enough fusion reactors, no worries. Give your Architect just one credit less than 5 million and the Architect will purchase goods as normal, keep giving them credits when low to buy all resources. Wait till you only need fusion reactors, give Architect more than 5 million and the architect will buy the fusion reactors, but watch the credits because if credits dip below 5 million it will stop. 


CWIR Alpha Version 0.6
1) All new BR.move.patrol script, thanks to Unitrader for help
2) Job Suppression script updates
3) Ships sold and built at shipyards (Capital ships only except when selling small ships but not small ships built) will have jobs as they should (all fixed now)
4) Changes to speed of invasions/defense and checks on faction strength (should be a slower experience now)
5) Lots of bug fixes, hopefully no more bugs.
6) War in Albion and Devries should be very interesting now (give me feedback, pls.)
7) Player is now entirely independent and can choose their own way (help other factions conquer, or conquer on your own but this is still being worked on)

16) Fixed debug log for safeshipmove_ooz script ($jumpdrive)
17) Fixed debug log for lawenforcement
18) Fixed debug log error for masstraffic.police watchdog (Needs testing to see if it is working. Let us know if you see any strange police behavior)

CWIR Alpha Version 0.5 
1) Some Bug fixes (KNOWN ISSUES DEBUG SPEW ABOUT BR.move.patrol) 
2) Job Suppression should now be working correctly 
3) Ships built at shipyards now do proper jobs and will have the right drones on them (all combat ships will have fighter drones and construction drones from the shipyard, etc.) Traders will trade, miners will mine. 
4) Some changes in what factions get what fleets and some condition changes. 
5) HOA will invade ascendancy if they can, will try to take the big empty first, then Buried treasure and then the rest of the sector if they can, but it will be difficult! 
6) Some changes to war in Devries, fleet changes and such (reivers are a little stronger)

CWIR Version 0. 4 Alpha 

1) New Populate player station with NPC script. Populates with all of the most useful NPC's and they will have a range of stars from 3 to 5. They are all wearing correct uniforms and could be from any faction/race. 

2) Fixes to Stromvok Cruisers, they had a hole in them heh 

3) Fixes to ships not attacking certain places (PMC and ROC were not fighting in Devries as they should). So now, all of Devries will be a war zone as it should be although Glaring truth will be secure until PMC and Reivers have a strong foothold in Devries. Once they do, the invasions of Glaring truth will happen and the ROC will be fighting for their lives hehe. 

4) Ships escorting capital ships will now be using a new script (Basically the MICT one) so when first installing the new version of the mod, there may be strange behavior at first as escorting ships will stop working until new ones spawn. 

5) ROC and HOA relations should not drop now! (I hope) 

6) I am going to remove the NEGATIVE reputation to the player for PMC and all of the Positive reputations. You are still essentially "Allies" to the ROC until Rubini gets back and we can work on changing that, but, now you will have more of a choice. You could decide to sort of side with PMC and help them conquer instead since relation with them will now be set to 0. ROC will still ask for help from you, though, etc. It is just a TEMPORARY fix for now. You could also just choose to be "neutral" and reap the benefits financially of the war. 

7) Will provide a new game start created by Airstrike Ivanov (Starts you in DEVRIES with some ships) 

CWIR VERSION 0.3 ALPHA 
-- Disabled CM Code for invasions. Response fleets are still active and will most likely remain active (I like it). 
-- Invasions done entirely by JOBS and patrolling fleets!!! BEWARE!!! 
-- Devries and Albion is a big war zone, but it is not chaotic but ordered chaos!! Factions will seek first to control strategic zones in order to expand and attack! Some places are especially dangerous, like Far Out! 

CWIR VERSION 0.2 ALPHA
-- Now includes code to allow for complete extermination of any faction in Albion or Devries. Have not touched Omicron or Maelstrom yet
-- Now there are conditions for fleets and fighter squadrons being spawned (this does not include CM spawns)
 For example, if PMC does not control Twilight Sentinel, but they control Auspicious Excavation, they will send a fleet to invade Twilight Sentinel. If they control Twilight Sentinel, they will spawn invasion fleets
 which will attack Devries. There are other such conditions (although it is still small in comparison to what it will be)
 
CWIR Version 0.1 Alpha
-- Mainly just WWX and CM merged with some custom jobs and a test version of the job suppression script.

WWX adds customized fleets (some with their own names and such). These fleets spawn in specific places and fly to wherever it is they are supposed to go. They will jump, boost and use gates. Capital ships
will Jump and sometimes boost (this is not reliable) together. Fighters will jump with their lead ship. This includes Player fleets and ships as well. Includes customized patrol and escort scripts. The MICT
Capital Escort script is merged with my Capital Escort Script (Thanks to w.evans)

WWX also adds new ships and shipyards to different factions (all used by the NPC factions) Includes my Player Shipyards mod and all its features plus more. If you want to get these new ships, you must buy them from
their respective faction shipyards. Some ships can not be bought from NPC shipyards. In order to build these "special" ships, you need to acquire (by boarding and capturing) CV's which spawn somewhere in the Universe.
These are only currently in Albion and Devries.

X:R Conquer mod v0.18s comments, tips and hints (be sure to read also the game rules below): 

1. This version (v0.18s) is almost a continuation of the main plot scenario. An allegiance between Player&Canteran got into a fight with a PMC&Pirates allegiance (all 3 pirates factions are now allied to PMC). Xenon is the common enemy, will invade all factions. Note also that all others factions relations are untouched; they are almost neutral between each other and to both rival allegiances above (well, not all of them, HOA is very Player&Canteran friend and are being harassed by PMC and SS, try to help them too). 

2. The main idea is to preserve the vanilla X:R gameplay, I mean, this is an Empire Build game, so it is slow and detailed - as is this war - it will happen in a slow pace. This is necessary because just to build a single ship or a single station on X:R it may take hours. Thus, if the war happens very quickly, you, the player, will not have enough time to build the necessary ships to fight, much less a working economy. This is the main aspect of the mod that can need balance in the future, although this version has already done a huge effort in this direction. 

3. In the mod md folder you will find a config file that has dozens of possible settings for a lot of aspects of the war. The most important one is about how and when invasion forces will be created. There you have settings for chances, interval, ships/fighters amount, xenon amount and the main one: a setting that controls when the invasions will start, which is especially important to give you the time to build at least a modest force first. Anyhow, you don´t need to modify anything, you can go directly to the game, the default values are good to go. The default is "4" which means that the invasions will only start after you, the player, have at least an index of 4 ships (a calc between military l and xl ships and trade xl ships), the invasion frequency will then increase as your fleet raises. Below, in the Conquer Mod Game rules you will get more info on this. 

4. Added basic pirate stations (and one capship patrolling them) for SS and HV pirate factions because they don’t have any on vanilla. SS are in Epsilon Lowlands, Albion and HV retreat to Sunken Frigate, Maelstrom - these places where chosen because they are empty, so no more changes are necessary and also to give future compatibility with WWX mod. 

5. Also added one HOA Construction Vessel (CV) for player faction in Forty-Two, Devries, full of useful wares. You just have to add an architect to it and choose with wisdom which station to build. This is just to speed things up a bit because you’ll really need some military ships soon. Vanilla game has serious issues at NPC shipyards that sometimes wait for some wares forever and then it can be "never" available to build ships for player as you will need it. So, this ship is very handful. But it’s not obligatory to use it anyway. Added also 3 new possible stations to be built from a Canteran's CV. They were chose to allow a more better strategic game play - as per above, raised the cost of Canteran's CV a bit. 

6. A good idea could be to trade at Omicron Lyrae because Albion is very dangerous now as PMC is all over the place there. However, It's not impossible to trade at Albion but you need to do it carefully so you won't lose your trade ships frequently. 

7. Use Probes to acquire info from distant unknown zones. Probes are a powerful tactical tool. 

8. Board and conquer enemy capships is also a good way to acquire a strong fleet and make money in early game. 

9. Build new stations and also replace the destroyed ones (even enemy ones) is crucial and an opportunity to maintain the economy and make money. You may do this by buying new CVs from Canteran or others factions and also using the Build Station Mission mod. 

10. This mod is intended for new free game starts. You can use the vanilla "Free Play" that start at Albion (go asap to Devries and establish there) or Yorrick's Devries FreeLancer Start mod. It won't fit well for other mods/starts that have different factions’ relations or very different places to start. 

11. This mod also has a workaround similar to Automated Emergency Jump mod, but it will work only for trade ships (military ships will always engage) and in certain conditions. It´s possible to enable / disable it, look into the config file. 

12. A bit more shield amount was given to capships to make the battles more eye candy and interesting. 

13. About other mods: Devries FreeLancer Start, Build Station Mission, Titurel Engine fix, Marine Rebalance, Copilot Convo and Manager Shipyard Connection - were tested and are highly recommended. Player shipyard, Ship&Station Recycle and Automated Emergency jump - although these could be good to improve the overall playability, they are not yet tested - but users feedback said that they are ok too. Also, any mod that changes the factions’ relations too much or has huge changes at military side is not compatible for now. This applies to WWX mod too. We plan to make them both compatible in a future. 

14. A frequent comment/question: this mod don't build new NPC trade stations when the AI invade and conquer zones. It only will build automated outposts. In truth, new npc trade stations are not necessary for the mod playability and for a good war game side. But it is in the “todo” list for the future, if really necessary and useful. 


X:R Conquer mod game rules: 
=================== 

1. This is a war between Player&canteran x PMC&Pirates. Xenon is a common enemy for all. To "win" the game you must defeat PMC&Pirates and survive from Xenon invasions. To do this you also actively need to protect and support Canteran´s stations and space. Another good idea is to also protect Heart of Albion, your allied on PMC territory.

2. Outpost’s automated builders are only carried by L or XL military ships or by Titurels . They will be only deployed (and then build an outpost) if a faction is the unique owner of at least one l or xl military ship (including Titurel) in an enemy, own or ownerless zone and also if no other outpost is present. Outposts are small automated stations that provide support, info and defense for a conquered zone. They are surrounded by a minefield so take care when trying to destroy one of them. Xenon will not build outposts; they are really the badass and will try to destroy everything in their way. 

3. If a faction have at least one station (an outpost is enough) in a zone and no enemies are present it will gain control (ownership) over that zone (if not already is the ownership). 

4. If a station (including outpost) is destroyed, the faction ownership of that station can build a retaliation force to try to counter attack. So, always attack aware that retaliations will be very probably. 

5. Factions in fight can invade enemy or ownerless zones after the player have a minimal force (see the config file). These forces are smart enough to look for strategic zones first: zones with gates, jumpbeacons, superhighways gates and rare resources. The invasion forces can also try zones with none or small forces as well. Its frequency and ship’s amount are linked, to a certain extent, to the faction strength and also with the opponent strength.

6. A working simple voiced Early Warning System will warning about any player capship or station that are in danger and also about enemy's invasion forces that jump at player or allied (canteran) space. Its sensibility and frequency can be adjusted on config file. Any message about OOZ events can open the holomap directly on the event zone (or sector as your choice on config file) by clicking on the flicking PDA. 

7. Each ship generate by this mod will consume shipyards wares. This will help the economy to stay alive, because the shipyards are the "end" products main consumer. This feature will move the economy chain as it should be. The amount of wares consumed is adjustable on config file. 

8. If a vanilla station is destroyed and that faction reconquer that zone (or don´t lose the zone at all) that station will be rebuilt soon or later (Note: only for npc stations). So to really conquer a zone, all enemy stations must be destroyed first. Thus, if no more enemy in the area and at least one l or xl military ship is in patrol (including Titurel), an outpost will be built and that zone will be then finally conquered. 

9. Stations can and will be also destroyed OOZ (out of zone) by the AI. 

10. Finally, as said above, if a faction loses all its producing stations (or pirate factions’ basic stations) it will no more generate invasion forces. They will lose the game. So, you must always protect and support Canteran stations to stay alive and could be a good idea to try to defeat Reivers at first. **Note that even if a faction is “not more on the war” the vanilla code will continue to spawn this faction ships here and there (in jobs.xml) but it will be not more a threat. Think about this as if that faction yet had a hidden zone somewhere but without capacity to create big forces anymore. However note that if a "dead" faction reconquer a zone it can return to the game. So it is a good idea to mantain a small force supporting the outpost if a zone is frequently harassed by vanilla small enemy forces. 

11. Trade and mine capships (l and xl) will try to avoid to enter in battle by jumping to a distant point from attackers - if right conditions are meet. Military ships will always engage. This is a new feature that can be enable(default)/disable in the config file, and also its sensibility can be adjusted. I don´t know how it will behave with Automated Emergency Jump mod; the main difference between them is that the inside solution is more adapted for Conquer mod, and only trade and mine capships will jump and they can do it preventively. 

12. Miner ships will now obey the Manager max range to mine (fix for vanilla bug). 

13. All Allied (Canteran) forces will deploy Probes ahead of its forces. Probes are advanced automated pods that that can detect and analyse objects far from its home base. 

14. Probes also can be deployed by player. Its very useful for tactical decitions: to determinate the best safe trade route, to acquire knowledge of a distant yet unknon zone and obviously to analyse a battle field. To deploy a Probe you need first to buy some from Equipment traders (eventually also second hands ones from Junker traders). See below more info on it. 

15. You can also command a probe to self destruction if you want to . Just select the probe from your "Properties", chose "Comm" and a "Destroy Probe" radial menu will appears . 

16. Player will not have ownership over any zone neither will build outpost. The Player&Canteran allegiance will always give ownership of conquered zones and build outpost for Canterans. (this is necessary to the game runs corrrectly and it really runs well this way) 

17. Tip: To defeat zones that have more than one enemy station, make it by parts. I mean, defeat the first station and then defeat the probably retaliation force. Now wait until your forces are fully repaired and shielded and start to defeat the second station the same way and so on. After all stations are destroyed and all enemies are defeated than left there at least one military capship (or a small force) in patrol and after some time the outpost will be built (Canteran outpost) and then, after a while, your allegiance will gain control over that zone. 


Installation?
=======
Just copy the entire "Conquer_Mod" folder to your X:R extensions folder.


Have fun and post feedback!
==================
Rubini.

==============================================
Changelog v0.18s:
- outposts are now really full automated - no human inside
- outposts have not more missions icons on it
- outposts are now self repairing as it should be 
- SS and HV small pirates stations are also now self repairing as it should be 
- a bit more big in size AI invasion forces when a zone to invade is full of enemies
- AI invasions frequency (including Xenon) is now also attached to player strenght (among other factors)
- a bit more chance for PMC and Xenon invasions (was nerfed too much)
- probes have a bit more hull HP to avoid quick destruction by fighters
- a recheck (in code) to avoid empty zones
==============================================

Changelog v0.17s:
- fix for localization: some crucial cues were using english names in the calc and this was leading errors for non english language users. Thanks to DaveDee and UniTrader for the help and fix.
- fixed a bug where SS and HV pirates factions were not allied to PMC. Now, correctly as the mod intend, the 3 Pirates factions are allied between them and PMC
- improved rules: "Build Stronghold" (outpost) rules: strongholds can now be built in zones with stations as before but with more restrict conditions.
(Note: is mandatory to restart a new game if you use another language than english, sorry).
========================================================================
Info update:
- Even that the war is fought mainly by Canteran&Player x PMC&Pirates x Xenon,  all others factions are alive and, althgout they will not invade, they will defend yourself buildind retaliation forces and strongholds if needed.
- this is particulary important for Heart of Albion that is very Player&Canteran friend and are being harassed by PMC and SS, try to help them too.
==============================================

Changelog v0.16s:
- Now you can click at any area on your PDA when an EWS message is displayed (about any OOz event) and the map will be opened directly on the area of the related event. The level of the opened map can be set at Config file (sector or zones). 
- added, with cicero111 permission, the 2 files from Better Turrets 2.1 mod into Conquer Mod. BT mod allow you to better control yours capships attacks. See below more info about Better Turrets mod. 
- added a routine for fighters and stations (player's or friends) to stop their attacks if the attacked enemy capship is being boarded and hull is below 50% (BT mod only allow it for capships). So, board is really a tactical option now, better if you use w. evans' MarineRebalance mod. 
- refined and made the ShipTradeSafeMove routine more smart , now also including mine ships, it will detect potential danger situations as before plus any attack to player's trade or mine ships (l or xl) and will jump them if right conditions were meet. 
- fixed a XR vanilla bug where the mine ships don't obey the manager max range space to mine. Now they do it properly. This is a fix eclusive for Conquer mod for now. I also made it smart enough to not send the mine ships to an enemy zone anymore. If you need to harvest an enemy zone you need to command the mine ship personally. An always good idea could be to conquest that zone first. :P 
- added Probes, see below
- fixed the name of the "Outpost" (no more "Warehouse")
- added voiced warning about Canteran invasions and Canteran counter attacks, this can be essential to properly attack some PMC crowded zones. 
- added few more voiced warnings, the faction relations will be more clearly declared on warnings now in certain situations 
- factions that lose all their producer stations or small stations for pirates (outpost don't count) will also not more generate retaliation forces (before v0.16s they only not generate invasion forces in this situation) 
- nerfed a bit more the number of ships on generated forces into the code 
- also some new default values on config file to fine tunned a bit more the number of capships in game .
- added few new tweaks for IZ and OOZ combat, the overall fight experience will be much better over vanilla. Succellus and Balor are very useful against stations now. Adjusted a bit Heavy Sul maneuverability, it was too agile for that ship size . 
- made escort fighters numbers a bit random. The settings in the config file are now for maximum number only. 
- added 3 new possible stations to be built from a Canteran's CV. They were chose to allow a more better strategic game play. 
- as per above, raised the cost of Canteran's CV a bit. 
==============================================
*Probes are a complex addition to X:R&CM. They are buyable from Equipment traders (and eventually second hands ones from Junk dealers too) and will go to your inventory. You can deploy probes to any place on your map. Just chose a normal "Plot Course" in your holomap and if you have probes a new menu choice will appears "Send Probe". If you want to send a Probe click on it, if not, just press "esc" and go to your plotted course normally. If "Send Probe" was chosen a probe will be deployed (from Skunk) and will go to a safe position (in front of Skunk) and then will jump to the designed destination. All this is full of fx effects. When the probe arrived to the destination zone it enters in a scan patrol mode and a flashing message will appears on your PDA. If you click on it the holomap will be opened directly over that zone (or sector, as your choice on Config file). In few seconds (from 10s to 20s) the probe will detect all objects on that zone (well, on its radar range). The probes can be destroyed by enemies if detected. Also you can command a self destruction for any probe if you want to (the probes are small automated ships without pilots and can crowd your ship lists - so you can destroy probes that aren´t more necessary if you want to - from your ship list, select a probe and select the "Comm" menu option, then a new menu you open with a option "Destroy Probe"). 

Probes are a very powerful tactical tool. You can send probes to better know about enemy forces on a given place or also to acquire trade safe routes and even to discover new places with interesting stations to trade. Also all allied (Canteran) forces send a probe ahead of its forces. Probes are also deployed in any allied zones that are being invaded by enemy forces. Probes are an integral part of Early Warning System.

* Better Turrets mod from cicero111 adds a lot of functionalities for capships Defence Officers. Below some important ones for Conquer mod:
(take a look on BT original thread to more info about it) 
1. In defencive instance, DO will try to disable  the target to allow it to be boarded (will aim only for weapons, turrets and engines)
2. In offensive instance, DO will try to destroy the target
3. If the player start the board process then capship's DO (player and  friend ones) will stop the attack if the target has less than 50% hull, even in offensive instance. 
4. The same applies to stations: in defencive instance, DO will try to disable the station; in offensive instance DO will try to destroy the station.
5. BT also uses "line of sight" when possible.
6. NPC capships will be always in offensive instance
7. Conquer mod made 2 small modifications on BT original files, allowing to a more agressive combat over stations and also skipping the crew skill check.
 ==============================================

Changelog v0.15s:
- It is now a war between Player&Canteran x PMC&Pirates. Xenon will invade all.
- deleted that annoying minefield at Fell Afliction
- added a bit more shield for capships
- added a preventive "jump when at danger" for trade capships
- OOZ intervention, now stations can and will be destroyed by AI OOZ (and in zone obviously)
- adjusted pirate stations modules hull value
- added zone, ships and pirate's stations to SS and HV pirate factions.
- new voiced EWS messages
- adjusted and lowered the frequency of EWS messages
- new settings on config file
- fixed a lot of small issues, allowing to a more consistent conquer game
- adjusted a bit more xenon invasion frequency and strength to be less powerfull
- adjusted rules and frequency of outpost builds to be less intrusive
- adjusted delay times to make the war a bit less quick
- added a HOA CV for player at the start of the game in Forty-Two
- dozens of fixes and code improve that i can´t recall
 ==============================================


Changelog v0.14:
- Remade the header of the mod to avoid critical problems when loading start cues
- Fixed the "new game" and "save game" bugs. Must start without problem in both situations.
- Prepared the code to receive patch in future releases without losing the previous saved games
 ==============================================

Changelog v0.13a:
-  Rised the boarding resistance for non pirates enemy fleets 
- All fighters are now faction specific 
- EWS have now (infinite) levels: 
level 1: will always warning if at least one enemy military xl or l ship is present in a zone which player have a capitalship or station (as it is now on V013) 
level 2: 50% chance for 1 enemy capship present and 100% chance when 2 or more enemy capship are present (the default now) 
level 3: 33% for 1 enemy capship present, 50% when 2 enemy capship are present, 100% chance when 3 or more are present 
level 4: 25% for 1 enemy capship present, 50% for 2 enemy capship present, 75% when 3 enemy capship is present and 100% when 4 or more enemy capship is present 
and so on. Infinite levels. Can be set on config file. 
- EWS_Level cutoff: the minimum number of enemy ships to trigger EWS. So, you can have EWS to level 4 but a cutoff of 1. It will works with chances as above but only for 2 or more enemy units and so on. Can be set on config file.
- EWS messages are now queued, what means that they never will showed/voiced one over another. The minimum interval is 25s and the check round each 3 min. 
- Logbook messages are more concise and with less empty lines. On PDA they are almost the same as before. 
- Fixed some issues related with Config file reserved variables
==============================================

Changelog v0.13:
- An spoken Global Early Warning System, that will inform you about any single enemy capship that enters any player&allied zones, any enemy capship that was encountered by player&allied when in travel, any enemy invasion in player&allied zones, and about any station destructed on galaxy by a spy net report. This EWS works also for vanilla ships (not only for this mod ships), what is very good! It´s voiced info is complemented with PDA and logbook detailed infos. 
- All capships created by this mod consumes shipyards resources, what will maintain the economy chain "forever". I guess!
- Factions without shipyards (or that loses its own) will "buy" ships from neutral shipyards (Ledda or JSS) 
- Config file with a lot more possible settings and a special one,  that can delay the init of the war (Invasions) until the player have a minimum amount of military capships (well, xl trade ships will count by half). With this feature you can adjust the war to your needs. You can have enough time to make at least a minimum force and money or go directly to the conflict. The choice is yours. Also a fine tune for "consume wares" issue. See inside it, self explanatory.
- all forces (capships and fighters) that are jumpin in, have a "jumpin in" fx effect.
- added the files to make pirates stations a bit more easy to be destroyed by your ships (a vanilla bug). I forget to add them on v0.12.

==================================================

Changelog v.012:
1. added Retaliation&Invasion forces capships types per faction. They can use xl or l ships (if any) with a chance. Xenon will only spawn in small number (1 or 2) because they are too powerful. It's configurable. 
2. the Stronghold is now really a small outpost but very well armed.
3. EWS (early warning system) for when enemy forces invade any player zone in the galaxy. 
4. Spy Net Report, that will report when any station is destroyed in any place. This provide the type of station, so, you can late build one of the same type to preserve the economy if you want it. Or in a future release, help an ally to build it. 
5. Now any destroyed station will generate Retaliation Force for any faction ( before, this was true only for player faction).
6. fixed an issue where in rare cases a Retaliation Force was create for player faction. Also checked the code for rebuild Stations, Invasions Forces, Stronghold : the idea is that all player faction intervention must be done by the player itself (when and where attack, build stations, etc).
7. An OOZ (out of zone) combat intervention on code, because the vanilla game have poor OOZ AI, yet worse for CapShips x Stations. Now the game force a  result (if needed) with a chance.  Isn't just numbers&code, the station will be really destroyed. It's configurable.
8. added a routine to stop to generate Invasion Forces for factions that don´t have at least one station. So, if no more stations this faction will die in time (note that vanilla code will continues to spawn this faction ships here and there, but will be not more a threat).
9. Enemy forces ships have now marines inside to prevent easy boarding.
10. Betty voices for all important events. Early Warning System, Spy Net reports, etc.This is really cool! Things like "Alert! Enemy forces jumpin in" said by betty is really awesome! :P
11. Adjusted the hull for some pirates stations components because this is really broken on vanilla. Now yours ships can also really destroy them.
12. Finally, a Config file where you can change various aspects of the mod like the chance and frequency of Enemy Forces, turn on/off OOZ intervention, change the Xenon Inv. forces ship's number, etc
